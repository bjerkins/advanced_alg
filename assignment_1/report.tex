\section*{Exercise 1}

  Figure \ref{fig:e1_a_solution} shows a b-flow with maximum value of 9 for the first proposed graph from the assignment. The second proposed graph from the assignment has no b-flow. The reason is that $v_1$ wants to have at least $3 + c(v_2, v_1)$ after giving away $f(v_1, v_3)$. In order for that to happen the $f(v_2, v_1)$ has to equal to $c(v_2, v_1)$. After the $f(v_2, v_1)$, $v_2$ wants to end up with 1 in demand, meaning it needs a flow value of 4 to itself but that is impossible because the maximum flow to $v_2$ is equal to $c(v_3, v_2)$, or 2 and therefore is unable to fulfill $f(v_2, v_1) = c(v_2, v_1)$.

    \sum_{f \in F, v \in V}(X_{vf}) + \sum_{f \in F, g \in F}(Z_{fg}-Z_{gf}) = \begin{cases}
                                                                                     4, & \text{if internal}\\
                                                                                    -4, & \text{if external}
                                                                               \end{cases}
\end{align*}

\subsection*{Exercise 2.3}
It is a necessary but not sufficient condition for $G$ to be a rectilinear layout that no vertex has degree greater than 4. We see that this is the case by looking at the different ways in which we can connect edges to a vertex. Given the constraints that edges mustn't cross, and that they must be either vertical or horizontal, we find that there are only four ways to connect an edge to a vertex, namely the four cardinal directions.
